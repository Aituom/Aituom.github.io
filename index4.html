            Leonhard Euler
            <p>(April 15, 1707 - September 18, 1783)</p>
          </h1>

          <div class="header-fourth">
            Euler was swiss mathematician and physicist, one of the founders of
            pure mathematics. He not only made decisive and formative
            contributions to the subjects of geometry, calculus, mechanics, and
            number theory but also developed methods for solving problems in
            observational astronomy and demonstrated useful applications of
            mathematics in technology and public affairs.

            <p>
              By means of his numerous books and memoirs that he submitted to
              the academy, Euler carried integral calculus to a higher degree of
              perfection, developed the theory of trigonometric and logarithmic
              functions, reduced analytical operations to a greater simplicity,
              and threw new light on nearly all parts of pure mathematics.
            </p>
            Overtaxing himself, Euler in 1735 lost the sight of one eye. Then,
            invited by Frederick the Great in 1741, he became a member of the
            Berlin Academy, where for 25 years he produced a steady stream of
            publications, many of which he contributed to the St. Petersburg
            Academy, which granted him a pension.
